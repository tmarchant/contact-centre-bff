# Contact Centre BFF

API proxies for the Contact Centre UI Application built on the Vert.x platform.

## Running locally

Run the Application class directly, or use `./gradlew run`. This will spin up the app on 
port 3000

## Configuration

Core application settings can be found in `application.properties`. Put any local changes you
need for dev stuff in `local.properties` - bear in mind this file is ignored by commits and 
won't be included in jar builds.

Environment-specifc versions of `local.properties` will be generated by Ansible.

## Required IntelliJ plugins

* Lombok - don't forget to enable Annotation Processing in IDE settings after install

## Git commit messages

### Format

{ticket} {Complete the sentence, "This commit will...."}

* Capitalise the message after the ticket number, do not end in a full stop 
* Use pseudo ticket with project/product id if commit is not for a ticket - eg OU-BFF for bff related stuff, OU-INFRA for infrastructure
* Max **69** characters so it doesn't get truncated in [git history](https://github.com/john-lewis-retail/contact-centre/commits/master)
* WHY not WHAT
* Leave a blank line between the title and any further detail
* [More detail on this blog post](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
